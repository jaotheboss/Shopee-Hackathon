Converting text to lower case** \n","* if your data is case insensitive, you'll need to consider your usecase as well\n","* some exceptions, if there're acronyms, which may lose their meaning if converted to word, e.g. in german language, MIT (university) vs mit (german for with)\n","\n","**2. Removing punctuations**\n","* exceptions, twitter data, where punctuations may be good in showing sentiment\n","\n","**3. Removing any numerical values**\n","\n","**4. Tokenize text**\n","* different ways to tokenize the text\n","\n","**5. Remove stop words**\n","* stop words can be altered to be usecase specific, \n","* e.g. adding restaurant name to list of stopwords for restaurant review, as the people will usually give the restaurant name in the review\n","* e.g. twitter you may want to add words like 'RT' 'Retweet' etc for tweets\n","\n","\n","**6. Stemming / lemmatization** \n","* different variation of words due to suffix, but the meaning of the word is the same, use of the word is identical, to prevent duplication of words being stored and improve efficiency\n","* lemmatization result is a proper word, unlike stemming\n","\n","\n","**7. Parts of speech tagging**\n","* good for identifying, summarising, to get e.g. retrieval of nouns from large pieces of texts (NNP)\n","\n","**8. Create bi-grams or tri-grams**\n","\n","**9.
